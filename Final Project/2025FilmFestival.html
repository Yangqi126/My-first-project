  <p><span class="bold-text">Global Voices, Local Screens: Celebrate Film in Syracuse 2025</span></p>

<p class="festival-paragraph">This year’s festival takes place from October 3–8 and will showcase over 120 films across 10 venues in downtown Syracuse. From compelling documentaries to thought-provoking narratives, animated shorts to experimental media, this year’s selection reflects the diversity and richness of global cinema. The theme, “Cinema Without Borders,” encourages both creators and audiences to explore stories that cross cultural, linguistic, and emotional boundaries. Each screening is an invitation to not just watch, but to engage, reflect, and feel.</p>

  <br>
 <p class="festival-paragraph">The festival opens with a special red carpet gala screening of Winds of September, a Taiwan-U.S. co-production that explores youth identity and diaspora memory. The lineup also includes standout selections from Cannes, Berlinale, and Sundance, as well as dozens of premieres from emerging indie filmmakers. Notably, this year features an expanded “Student Spotlight” program, showcasing short films from local universities—including Syracuse University and SUNY Binghamton—as well as international student filmmakers from the UK, South Korea, and Brazil.</p>

  <p class="festival-paragraph">In addition to screenings, the festival hosts daily filmmaker Q&As, production workshops, and live industry panels featuring editors, composers, and cinematographers. One of the festival’s highlights is the Sound & Score Pavilion—an immersive exhibition that examines the relationship between music and moving image. Here, visitors can experience silent films scored live by contemporary musicians, or create their own film soundtracks in interactive booths.</p>

  <p class="festival-paragraph">The Sophie Award returns this year to honor cinematic works that advance social justice, climate awareness, and mental health advocacy. Finalists include a Ukrainian documentary about frontline medics, a coming-of-age drama set in Nairobi, and a powerful essay film exploring Indigenous sovereignty in North America. Winners will be announced during the closing ceremony at the historic Landmark Theatre.</p>

 <p class="festival-paragraph">his year’s festival also introduces several new initiatives. The Open-Air Screening Series brings films to parks and rooftops across the city, turning Syracuse into a cinema under the stars. The Filmmaker-in-Residence Program invites three selected directors to stay in Syracuse for a month-long creative residency, collaborating with local artists and students. And the Global Kids & Family Cinema track offers family-friendly screenings and storytelling workshops designed to spark young imaginations.</p>

  <p class="festival-paragraph">What makes the Syracuse Film Festival unique is not only its programming, but its atmosphere. There’s an intimacy and authenticity to this gathering—filmmakers and audiences often sit side by side, exchanging ideas long after the credits roll. Cafés near the screening venues buzz with conversation, and even first-time attendees quickly feel part of something bigger: a shared love for cinema’s ability to reveal truth and forge connection.</p>

 <p class="festival-paragraph">The city of Syracuse itself becomes a backdrop to this cultural moment. Local restaurants host pop-up events themed around festival films, museums and galleries extend their hours to accommodate visitors, and the streets fill with posters, music, and conversation. In this space, art and community co-create something vibrant and lasting.</p>

  <p class="festival-paragraph">Tickets go on sale starting September 1 through the festival website and partner box offices. Discount passes are available for students, seniors, and community members. If you're a filmmaker, submissions remain open until August 1. We accept works in all formats, including narrative, documentary, animation, hybrid, and immersive VR/XR pieces. Selected filmmakers receive accommodation support and access to networking events, press coverage, and distribution consultations.</p>

  <p class="festival-paragraph">Volunteers are also welcome. Every year, dozens of students, artists, and local residents power the festival from behind the scenes—ushering guests, setting up equipment, conducting interviews, and more. In return, they gain valuable experience and lasting memories from one of the most vibrant cultural events in upstate New York.</p>

  <p class="festival-paragraph">Join us in celebrating the art of film—right here in Syracuse.Whether you're a director, producer, actor, critic, student, or simply someone who loves a good story, there’s a place for you at the Syracuse 2025 Film Festival. Let’s gather to experience the laughter, the heartbreak, the beauty, and the magic of the movies—together.</p>
